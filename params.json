{"name":"Swag Tech Overview","tagline":"Tunapanda project documentation","body":"## Introduction\r\n \r\nSwag is a system for guiding learners through different learning paths. It does not dictate a \r\nspecific path to the learner, but suggests that some knowledge are prerequisites to other \r\nknowledge. It engages the user by relying on metaphors from computer games, and tries to \r\ntrigger the users curiosity for exploration and desire for completeness.  \r\n \r\n## Concepts\r\nThere are some concepts that work together to make up the complete system. These are described in more detail on the following pages. \r\n \r\n### ● Swagmap \r\nA map of interconnected nodes that guides the user through the learning experience. \r\n  \r\n### ● Swagifact \r\nAn atom of learning. Each node in the swagmap is a swagifact. \r\n \r\n### ● Learning Record Store \r\nThe database that keeps track of which swagifacts each user has completed. \r\n \r\n### ● Reporting Applications \r\nAn application that sits in the background and gather information about what the user does and reports this to the Learning Record Store. \r\n![arch](https://github.com/tunapanda/tunapanda.github.io/blob/master/images/swagmap.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n## Swagmaps\r\n![swag](https://github.com/tunapanda/tunapanda.github.io/blob/master/images/swag.png?raw=true)\r\nA Swagmap is a map of interconnected nodes. Each node represents a swagifact, and a node can be shown as complete or not yet completed. Depending on how the swagmap is defined, certain swagifacts can be set as prerequisites for other swagifacts, so the depending swagifacts are not shown unless the prerequisites are completed. \r\n \r\nClicking on a swagifact in the swagmap will open up information showing what the user needs to do for that swagifact to be \r\ncompleted. If the swagifact can be completed online, the user will be taken directly to where the swagifact can be completed. \r\n \r\nThe swagmap software is a web based software and is currently in an early stage of development. It currently looks like in the top right figure. Here, the circles represents the swagifacts, and the one marked in red is represented as \r\ncompleted. This is a technical prototype to test the functionality, the goal is that this should be a compelling, game like interface with game like interaction metaphors and animations. The following images can be seen as a mood board to serve as inspiration for what we want the application to look like eventually.  \r\n \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
