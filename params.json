{"name":"Swag Tech Overview","tagline":"Tunapanda project documentation","body":"## Introduction\r\n \r\nSwag is a system for guiding learners through different learning paths. It does not dictate a \r\nspecific path to the learner, but suggests that some knowledge are prerequisites to other \r\nknowledge. It engages the user by relying on metaphors from computer games, and tries to \r\ntrigger the users curiosity for exploration and desire for completeness.  \r\n \r\n## Concepts\r\nThere are some concepts that work together to make up the complete system. These are described in more detail on the following pages. \r\n \r\n### ● Swagmap \r\nA map of interconnected nodes that guides the user through the learning experience. \r\n  \r\n### ● Swagifact \r\nAn atom of learning. Each node in the swagmap is a swagifact. \r\n \r\n### ● Learning Record Store \r\nThe database that keeps track of which swagifacts each user has completed. \r\n \r\n### ● Reporting Applications \r\nAn application that sits in the background and gather information about what the user does and reports this to the Learning Record Store. \r\n![arch](https://github.com/tunapanda/tunapanda.github.io/blob/master/images/swagmap.png?raw=true)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
