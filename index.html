      <p>Introduction</p>

<p>Swag is a system for guiding learners through different learning paths. It does not dictate a 
specific path to the learner, but suggests that some knowledge are prerequisites to other 
knowledge. It engages the user by relying on metaphors from computer games, and tries to 
trigger the users curiosity for exploration and desire for completeness.  </p>

<p>Concepts
There are some concepts that work together to make up the complete system. These are 
described in more detail on the following pages. </p>

<p>● Swagmap 
A map of interconnected nodes that guides the user through the learning experience. </p>

<p>● Swagifact 
An atom of learning. Each node in the swagmap is a swagifact. </p>

<p>● Learning Record Store 
The database that keeps track of which swagifacts each user has completed. </p>

<p>● Reporting Applications 
An application that sits in the background and gather information about what the user 
does and reports this to the Learning Record Store. </p>
